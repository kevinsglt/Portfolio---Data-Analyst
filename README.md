# Shopping-Trends_Project

This repository contains my first Data project. 

This is my first project in Python, please don't hesitate to give me feedback, thank you! 
I made data visualization with Tableau Software too for practice.

The dataset comes from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/customer-shopping-trends-dataset
